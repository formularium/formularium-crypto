No, seriously, as there is currently no implementation of jwk x509 chain validation available (including verification against certificate revocation lists, OCSP, â€¦)
We implemented it on our own. It's based on PKI.js, so we didn't actually start from scratch. 
### Why?
formularium implements the FIT-Connect standard. It requires us to validate the JWK cert chains we use in the browser for encryption.
